I've tried to make this a simple as possible to understand, but sadly computers are awful at interpreting complex and often ambiguous language, so it's a little complicated. The canonical format Every pronoun set that the plugin uses has a canonical format. Even if you don't see or interact with it, every set has one of these, either hardcoded into the plugin, the config or the cloud database. It looks like this: subjective/objective/progressive/possessive adjective/possessive pronoun/reflexive Subjective They will do it if you ask nicely. Objective I'd really love to get to know them . Progressive They're a very cool person. (This isn't actually a pronoun, instead being a contraction of the subjective and conjugated verb \"to be\". It's just helpful to have.) Possessive adjective I hope their day is going well. Possessive pronoun Whose is that? Oh, it's theirs . Reflexive This person should be really proud of themself . Writing out the canonical format can be a little confusing, so I wrote a webpage as part of the cloud to simplify it. Complete the sentences by filling out the boxes and it'll do the rest for you. Setting your pronouns (if you're here from a plugin help link, welcome!) Fortunately, with common pronouns you don't have to worry about the canonical format - the plugin will try its best to match anything with a set. For example, she , they , he/him , they/fae/she and any are all understood by the plugin just fine. There are situations where the plugin has multiple sets to choose from, for example xe . At the time of writing, the database contains two variations on this set, xe/xem/xe\u2019s/xyr/xyrs/xemself and xe/xer/xe's/xer/xers/xerself . It will pick one at random to use and inform you that it couldn't figure out which one you wanted. In this case, add more pronouns on the end until it's no longer ambiguous, or use the canonical format.","title":"Formats"},{"location":"formats/#formats","text":"The English language is a pain.

Place the downloaded plugin into your server's plugins folder. (Bukkit-based servers only) Optionally install PlaceholderAPI. Restart your server. You're done! The plugin has a sane default configuration and will work \"out of the box\", but there are some settings you may want to change. See the next page for more info. ProNouns Cloud ProNouns Cloud is a service that defines commonly used neopronouns so people don't need to type out the entire thing every time. By default, recent versions of ProNouns (2.0.0+) will automatically and anonymously send pronoun sets that aren't in the list back to the server, subject to manual moderation on my end. If you don't wish to participate in this, you can opt out from the config: # ProNouns Cloud-related settings cloud: # Should the plugin regularly download the list of pronouns from the server and make them available to players? sync: true # Should the plugin anonymously submit unrecognised sets back to the server? upload: true When sync: true , the list will be regularly downloaded from the server, and placed into a file called pronouns.json at the root of the plugin's config directory. It can also be manually updated by using the command /pn cloud sync or by downloading the file from https://pn.lucypoulton.net . Using MySQL ProNouns supports MySQL to synchronise pronouns across multiple servers. You'll need to create a user and database for it (note this step may vary depending on your hosting provider, contact them if in doubt): CREATE DATABASE pronouns; CREATE USER pronouns@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'a long, secure password'; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON pronouns.* TO pronouns@localhost; FLUSH PRIVILEGES; Then in the ProNouns config, add your user, database and password: connection: 'mysql' # remember to set this! mysql: host: '127.0.0.1' port: 3306 database: 'pronouns' username: 'pronouns' password: 'your password here' Moderation and admin commands To allow a player to act as a moderator, grant the permission pronouns.admin . This will do the following: Grants access to admin commands ( setother , clearother , reload , cloud ) Player is notified when a player without the bypass permission tries to use a set blocked by the filter Player is notified when an update becomes available It's recommended to also grant pronouns.bypass to allow these players to bypass the filter in case of a false positive.","title":"Setup"},{"location":"setup/#installation","text":"Installing the plugin is super simple: Download the plugin from https://lucypoulton.net/pronouns - take care to choose the correct file for your server platform.
